## Student: Carlos Alberto Castro Hoyos

## Introduction:

Monte Carlo simulation uses random sampling and statistical modeling to estimate mathematical functions and mimic the operations of complex systems. (Harrison, Granja and Leroy, 2021). Mainly, this method inverts the usual problem of statistics: rather than estimating random quantities in a deterministic manner, random quantities are employed to provide estimates of deterministic quantities. On the other hand, ATRP is another kind of carrying ourt living polymerization. This method sets up an equilibrium between a dormant phase of polymer chains and a growing phase. In the dormant phase, radicals have been trapped and are protected from termination, but are also unable to participate in polymerization. In the growing phase, radical chains have been released and can continue to grow by adding monomers in a radical mechanism. The idea is to release just a few radical chains at a time, recapturing them before they have a chance to undergo chain termination events (Living Radical Polymerization- ATRP, 2021). The mechanism depicted is shown in the figure No. 1.

Knowing the theorical foot for these models, it is possible to develop a dynamic Monte Carlo model in order to simulate an atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). This simulation includes the calculation of different stages ocurring during the polymerization: Activatiod, deactivation, propagation, termination by combination and transfer to monomer. Through the definition of every reaction rate, it is possible to estimate the monomer conversion, the polydispersity and the complete molecular weight distribution. Basically, these predicions may be represented by graphics showing the performance of the simuation (Monte Carlo) and polymerization (ARTP) applied. 

## Methodology: 

## Results:
  
No results for the aimed properties (the monomer conversion, the polydispersity and the complete molecular weight distribution) were obtained as the simulation based on Monte Carlo did not run properly.
